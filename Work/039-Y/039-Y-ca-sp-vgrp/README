There was a pseudopotential '039-Y-ca-sp-vgrp' introduced in the
July 24 2002 version of the library, but there its input file
specified accidentally that an 's' eigenvalue was to be used as the
reference energy in a 'd' channel.  Although this mistake probably
has little or no effect on the quality of the resulting potential,
it is aesthetically ugly, and we have chosen to retract the potential.

A very similar potential with this cosmetic defect removed is now
available at 039-Y-ca-sp-vgrp_ji.
