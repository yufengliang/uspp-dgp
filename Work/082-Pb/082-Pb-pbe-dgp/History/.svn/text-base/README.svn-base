Historical notes

1. dks.report is the "pseudopotential report" for Dominic King-Smith's
original Pb pseudopotential in June 1993.

Note that etot is slightly different.

2. pb_ps_e25.adat and pb_ps_e18.adat are the original input files for
pseudopotential generation (appropriate for an earlier version of the
program). They differ in the number of "fixing" parameters. 

(The pseudopotential input above corresponds to pb_ps_e18.adat)
