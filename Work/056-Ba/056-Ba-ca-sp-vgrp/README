Introductory information
------------------------

Generated in neutral s2 configuration; semicore sp shells included.

This Ba potential was generated in the early 1990's by some member
of my group, probably D. King-Smith.  I believe it has been used
successfully in studies of BaTiO3 and other perovskites.

--------------------
Intended environment
--------------------

Mostly for Ba in oxides where it is in the 2+ formal oxidation
state.  It should probably be OK for metallic Ba too, but I don't
think we ever tried it for that.
