Introductory information
------------------------

Generated in +1 ionic s2d1 configuration; semicore sp shells included.

A Zr potential similar to this was generated in the early 1990's,
probably by D. King-Smith, using version a5.0.1.  However, it was
not successfully updated for a7.3.2 and subsequent versions until
just now (July 2002) by DV.  I did it by changing rinner to 0.9 and
this removed problems with negative densities, so constraints are not
needed.

--------------------
Intended environment
--------------------

Mostly for Zr in oxides where it is in the 4+ formal oxidation
state.  It should probably be OK for metallic Zr too, but I don't
think we ever tried it for that.
