Introductory information
------------------------

Generated in +1 ionic s1 configuration; semicore sp shells included.

This Ca potential was generated by me in August 2002.  It only
has a single p projector and a single d projector.  Its quality
may thus be a little bit questionable; it should be tested carefully
before further use.

--------------------
Intended environment
--------------------

Mostly for Ca in oxides where it is in the 2+ formal oxidation
state.
