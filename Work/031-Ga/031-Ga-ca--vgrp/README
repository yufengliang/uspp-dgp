Introductory information
------------------------

Generated in neutral s2p1 configuration.

This Ga potential was generated in the early 1990's by some member
of my group, probably D. King-Smith.  I'm not sure what the intended
application was, but it may have been for studies of polarization in
GaAs.

Intended environment
--------------------

Mostly for Sr in oxides where it is in the 2+ formal oxidation
state.  It should probably be OK for metallic Sr too, but I don't
think we ever tried it for that.
