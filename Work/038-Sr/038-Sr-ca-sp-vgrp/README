Introductory information
------------------------

Generated in neutral s2 configuration; semicore sp shells included.

This Sr potential was generated in the early 1990's by some member
of my group, probably D. King-Smith.  I believe it has been used
successfully in a number of studies including those on SrTiO3.

Thanks to Davide Ceresoli for help with installing this potential
in the library.

--------------------
Intended environment
--------------------

Mostly for Sr in oxides where it is in the 2+ formal oxidation
state.  It should probably be OK for metallic Sr too, but I don't
think we ever tried it for that.

Summary of atomic transferability tests
---------------------------------------

There is a test for the s1 configuration in the distribution:

   nlm    all-elec      pseudo        diff

   400   -3.477981   -3.477840   -0.000141
   410   -2.147436   -2.147419   -0.000017
   500   -0.631142   -0.631117   -0.000024
