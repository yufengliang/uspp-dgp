Introductory information
------------------------

Generated in +1 ionic s2d2 configuration; semicore sp shells included.

This Nb potential was generated in the early 1990's by some member
of my group, probably D. King-Smith.  I believe it has been used
successfully in studies of KNbO3, NaNbO3, etc.

--------------------
Intended environment
--------------------

Mostly for Nb in oxides where it is in the 5+ formal oxidation
state.  It should probably be OK for metallic Nb too, but I don't
think we ever tried it for that.
