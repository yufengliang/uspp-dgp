Introductory information
------------------------

Generated in neutral s2p4 configuration. Projectors for
the d-channel are included.

Potential is optimized for a plane wave cut-off of 25 Ry and was generated
in April 2002 together with the iron potential:

026-Fe-gpbe-sp-bm

--------------------
Intended environment
--------------------

Sulfide compounds, but should be pretty general, I suppose.

Summary of atomic transferability tests
---------------------------------------

Nothing to report.

Solid-state tests
-----------------

FeS, pyrite structure (E_pw = 25 Ry):

lattice constant:    a = 10.226 bohr
internal coordinate: u = 0.3829
bulk modulus:        B = 157 GPa
