Introductory information
------------------------

Generated in neutral s2p4 configuration.

This oxygen potential was generated in the early 1990's by some member
of my group, probably D. King-Smith.  I believe it has been used
successfully in a number of studies of perovskite ferroelectrics
and other oxides.

Thanks to Davide Ceresoli for help with installing this potential
in the library.

Intended environment
--------------------

Probably OK for most oxides in normal conditions.

Summary of atomic transferability tests
