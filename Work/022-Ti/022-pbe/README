**************************************************************
Warning:

   Due to an oversight, the Ti potential included in distribution
   uspp-733 was not precisely the intended one.
   
   The potential `022-Ti-ca-sp-vgrp' in uspp-733 has been renamed
   `022-Ti-ca-sp-vgrp_alt' in uspp-734 and subsequent versions;
   it is generated in the neutral configuration.
   
   The potential `022-Ti-ca-sp-vgrp' in uspp-734 and subsequent
   versions is the intended one: it is generated in the +1 ionic
   configuration.

Introductory information
------------------------

Generated in neutral s2d2 configuration; semicore sp shells included.

See warning above.  I think this potential may be of almost equal
quality to the one generated in the ionic configuration, but it
has not been extensively tested.

--------------------
Intended environment
--------------------

See warning above.

---------------------------------------
Summary of atomic transferability tests
---------------------------------------

There is a test for the s2d1 configuration in the distribution.

Solid-state tests
